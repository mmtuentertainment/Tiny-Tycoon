## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### The Physics Prize ($100 to Charity) 🏆
**Read This**: `knowledge-base/01-littlejs/03-physics-collision.md`

**What Wins**:
- Novel physics mechanics
- Creative collision responses
- Technical excellence
- Innovation evident in 30 seconds

**Examples**:
- Unique gravity wells
- Chain reaction explosions
- Satisfying bouncy mechanics
- Creative momentum-based gameplay

### Theme: "SMALL"
**Multiple Interpretations**:
- Scale (tiny character, microscopic world)
- Minimalism (few mechanics, limited colors)
- Technical (small file size, compact code)
- Emotional (small moments, personal stories)

**Best Approach**: Combine 2-3 interpretations!

### 31-Day Workflow (SDD)
**Read This**: `knowledge-base/04-integration/01-sdd-for-game-dev.md`

```
Days 1-3:   Specify theme interpretation
Days 4-5:   Plan technical approach
Day 6:      Break into tasks
Days 7-26:  Implement systematically
Days 27-31: Polish and submit
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Learning
1. **Build tiny prototypes** - Don't aim for complete games yet
2. **Study the examples** - LittleJS repo has 13+ working games
3. **Ask in Discord** - Community is helpful and active
4. **Focus on physics** - It's worth $100 to charity!

### For the Jam
1. **Start with spec** - Use /speckit.specify for theme
2. **Test early** - Deploy to itch.io by day 10
3. **Polish matters** - Particles, screen shake, audio feedback
4. **Submit early** - Don't wait until last hour!

### For Success
1. **One mechanic done well** > Multiple shallow features
2. **Physics innovation** = Competitive advantage
3. **"SMALL" theme** = Required, make it clear
4. **Community engagement** = Motivation and feedback
