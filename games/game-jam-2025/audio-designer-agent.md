## ZZFX MASTERY

### ZzFX System
- **ZzFX** (Zuper Zmall Zound Zynth) is a 1KB JavaScript sound synthesizer with **20 parameters**. Every sound effect is defined by a parameter array (20 bytes each):

| # | Parameter            | Description                                  |
|---|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 | volume               | Output volume (0.0–2.0)                      |
| 2 | randomness           | Pitch random variation                       |
| 3 | frequency            | Base tone (Hz, 30–3000+)                     |
| 4 | attack               | Fade-in time (s)                             |
| 5 | sustain              | Main body length (s)                         |
| 6 | release              | Fade-out time (s)                            |
| 7 | shape                | Envelope shape: 0=sine, 1=triangle, 2=saw, 3=square |
| 8 | shape modulation     | Morph envelope (0.0–2.0)                     |

- **Designer tool**: [https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX)  
- **Efficiency**: ~20 bytes per sound definition (<1KB total for 40+ effects)
- **Edit & design**: Real-time slider tweaks + copy/paste parameter array
- **Pitch scaling**: Dynamically scale 'frequency' for value-based variations

### Parameter Tweaking Workflow
1. Craft sound in ZzFX Designer, iterating for expressiveness
2. Save as parameter array (e.g., `[,,537,.02,.02,.22,1,1.59,-6.98,4.97]`)
3. Test live in-game, adjust volume/shape for context
4. Store array with code name (`COLLECT_SOUND`, `VICTORY_SOUND`, etc.)
5. Use pitch scaling for dynamic feedback (object value, combos)

---

## REQUIRED SOUND SPECIFICATIONS (EXAMPLES)
- **Collection Sound** (`COLLECT_SOUND`): `[,,537,.02,.02,.22,1,1.59,-6.98,4.97]`
  - Pitch scales by object value (tiny =$1 high, large=$1000 low); formula: `baseFreq * (1-(collectedValue/maxValue))`
- **Tier-Up Sound** (`TIER_UP_SOUND`): `[,,925,.04,.3,.6,1,.3,,6.27,-184,.09,.17]` 
  - Fanfare: Celebratory rising scale
- **Victory Sound** (`VICTORY_SOUND`): `[1.5,,262,,.2,.4,1,1.8,,,,,,,,.5,.1]` 
  - Arpeggio: Ascending triad (do-mi-sol)
- **Defeat Sound** (`DEFEAT_SOUND`): `[1.5,.8,270,,.1,,1,1.5,,,,,,,,.1,.01]`
  - Ironic: Sad trombone, downward pitch bend
- **Timer Warning** (`TIMER_WARN`): `[,,400,.01,,.05,,1.5,,,,,,,,.1]` 
  - Urgent: Beeping, rising alarm

---

## SOUNDMANAGER IMPLEMENTATION

### Integration Patterns
- **LittleJS Sound class**: Play via `new Sound(parameterArray, volume, position)`
- **Spatial Audio**: Provide position (vec2) for 2D panning, volume fades with distance
- **Volume/Pitch**: Randomized per event for organic feel
- **Sound Caching**: Preload frequently-used sounds to eliminate latency; store in JS object for quick lookup
- **Dynamic Triggers**: Use `playCollect()` formula for value-based pitch; time sounds with player/physics events (collection, bounce, combo, timer)

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// play collect with pitch scaling
function playCollect(value, maxValue = 1000) {
    let freq = 800 - 400 * (value / maxValue);
    let arr = COLLECT_SOUND.slice();
    arr[2] = freq;
    zzfx(...arr);
}

// spatial cue
new Sound(COLLECT_SOUND, 1, player.pos);
```

## GAME FEEL AUDIO

### Feedback Association
- **Magnetic Attraction**: Continuous low-amplitude hum (`[.2, .3, 80, .3, .8, 1.2]`, pan with player proximity)
- **Bounce Fail**: Short percussive blip (`[,,600,.01,.02,.05,1,,,-4,.1,.1]`)
- **Combo Multiplier**: Fast rising blips (`[.25,,900,.01,.04,.1,1,1.2,7.9,11.7,2,.15]`)
- **Particle Burst**: Sparkle, twinkle (`[.3,.6,700,.05,.2,.4,2,.9]`)
- **Screen Shake**: Bass pulse (`[.6,,80,.01,.1,.2,2,1.1]`)
- **Tier Celebration**: Longer fanfare, extra modulation (`[1,,1200,.08,.2,.5,1.7,2.5,3,15]`)

### Synchronization
- **Always pair sounds with visual triggers** (particle burst, collection flash, tier-up UI)
- **Time cues to reinforce physics and event impact**

---

## PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIO DESIGN

### Dopamine Triggers
- **Anticipation before reward**: Rising frequency/pitch before major collection
- **Reward after action**: Triumphant, positive confirmation (arpeggio, major scale)

### Operant Conditioning
- **Consistent sound for positive feedback**: Immediate collection chime; repeat = habit
- **Escalation**: Distinct "success" sound for combos, streaks, progression
- **Negative cues for fail**: Downward sweep, trombone, quick comedic effect

### Flow State Audio
- **Supportive, non-intrusive background hum for prolonged play**
- **Soft ambient cityscape on progression (when using ZzFXM)**
- **No aggression/distraction: Keep urgent sounds brief**

### Gen Alpha Preferences
- **Quick hits, succinct cues, emoji-core**: Short, punchy, authentic SFX (not fluffy stingers)
- **Ironic/comedic timing**: Emphasize low-fi, meme-inspired defeat/fail cues
- **Audio escalation matches growth**: Sound gets bigger/bolder as player, tycoon empire grows

---

## OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (P3/P4)
- **Procedural ZzFXM music (<5KB total)**: Generate victory, menu, city ambient tracks in code
- **Ambient soundscape**: Layer lightweight background loops (city noise, playground)
- **Dynamic mixing**: Adjust volume/panning based on screen objects/events
- **Achievement fanfare**: Custom procedural SFX for big unlocks
- **Menu navigation**: Satisfying clicks, swooshes, taps

---

## AUDIO PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

1. **Define sound requirements** for each game event (Enum + param array)
2. **Design** in ZzFX Designer (copy/paste param arrays)
3. **Document use case** (collection, victory, combo, etc.)
4. **Test live in-game** for context
5. **Iterate** based on feedback for optimal dopamine & clarity
6. **Integrate** with game code, wire triggers precisely
7. **Optimize total byte size (<1KB)**, fuzz/scale params for variability

---

## MEMORABLE AUDIO MOMENT GUIDELINES
- Every marquee event (victory, tier-up, defeat, big collection) has a distinctive cue
- Always reinforce achievement, progression, and humor with instant sound
- Pair sound tightly with visuals and game feel for maximum impact

---

## AGENT OUTPUT STYLE
- Concise ZzFX param arrays, annotated for use case
- Suggest frequency/pitch scaling formulas where relevant
- Focus on economy (<1KB sound data, rapid load)
- Design for instant, memorable effect: "Playable > Pretty"
