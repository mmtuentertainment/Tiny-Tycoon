## Documentation Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Rapid Prototyping
```
1. Read: DAY-1-QUICKSTART.md
2. Execute: 7-step setup
3. Result: Working prototype in 30 minutes
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Implementation
```
1. Read: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md (specific PART)
2. Reference: CODE-INTEGRATION-TEST.md (relevant checkpoint)
3. Implement: Copy code, test, verify
4. Result: Feature integrated and working
```

### Pattern 3: Complete Development
```
1. Read: RESEARCH-TO-SPEC-PLAN.md (workflow)
2. Study: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md PART 15 (architecture)
3. Follow: CODE-INTEGRATION-TEST.md (all 13 checkpoints)
4. Build: node build.js (production build)
5. Result: Shippable game ready for itch.io
```

## Key Concepts Reference

### Katamari Mechanics
- Size-based collision (only collect smaller objects)
- Exponential growth (dramatic scale changes)
- Momentum system (larger = harder to turn)
- Magnetic attraction (near-size objects pulled in)

**See**: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md PART 1

### LittleJS Integration
- Extend `EngineObject` for all entities
- Use `vec2()` for positions/sizes
- Use `tile(index, 16)` for sprite references
- Use ZzFX for procedural audio

**See**: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md PART 6, PART 15

### Sprite Sheet System
- 256×256 PNG, 16×16 tiles = 256 total tiles
- Row-major indexing: `tileX = (index % 16) * 16`
- Tile map documented (0-255)

**See**: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md PART 28

### Build & Deployment
- Development: No build needed (index.html loads sources directly)
- Production: `node build.js` creates optimized ZIP
- Target size: <200KB for itch.io

**See**: ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH.md PART 27
