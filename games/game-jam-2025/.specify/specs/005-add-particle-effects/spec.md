# Feature Specification: Particle Effects System

**Feature Branch**: `005-add-particle-effects`
**Created**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add particle burst effects on every object collection using LittleJS ParticleEmitter. Particle count and size should scale with object value. Create visual celebration with yellow/orange particles that burst outward and fade."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - See Visual Burst on Collection (Priority: P3)

As a player, when I collect an object, I want to see colorful particles burst from the object's position so that collections feel visually satisfying and I get immediate visual feedback.

**Why this priority**: P3 (Polish) - Visual feedback is critical for "game feel." Particles make each collection an EVENT rather than silent disappearance. Vision.md research: "Particles on EVERY action separates good from great."

**Independent Test**: Collect one penny. See 10-20 yellow/orange particles burst outward from penny position, fade out over 0.5 seconds. No other systems needed - pure visual feedback test.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player collects small object ($1-$100), **When** collection occurs, **Then** 10-20 particles burst from object position
2. **Given** player collects medium object ($100-$10K), **When** collection occurs, **Then** 20-30 particles burst from object position
3. **Given** player collects large object ($10K+), **When** collection occurs, **Then** 30-50 particles burst from object position
4. **Given** particles are emitted, **When** 0.5 seconds pass, **Then** all particles have faded to transparent and been destroyed

---

### User Story 2 - Massive Celebration on Tier-Up (Priority: P3)

As a player, when I cross a tier threshold, I want to see a BIG particle explosion with MORE particles and different colors so that tier-ups feel MORE special than regular collections.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Tier-ups are major milestones. Need visual distinction from regular collections (not just "more of same"). Rainbow/golden particles signal achievement.

**Independent Test**: Manually trigger tier-up. See 100 particles burst from player position (5x more than collection). Rainbow colors or golden particles. Lasts longer (1.0 second vs 0.5). Visually MUCH more impressive than collection burst.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player crosses tier threshold, **When** tier-up triggers, **Then** 100 particles emit from player center
2. **Given** tier-up particles emit, **When** animation plays, **Then** particles use golden/rainbow colors (different from yellow/orange collection particles)
3. **Given** tier-up particles emit, **When** animation completes, **Then** particles fade over 1.0 second (2x longer than collection particles)

---

### User Story 3 - Magnetic Pull Visual Indicator (Priority: P3)

As a player, when objects are being magnetically pulled toward me, I want to see subtle particle trails or glow effects so that I understand the magnetic system is working and anticipate collection.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Makes invisible magnetic force VISIBLE. Helps players understand mechanic. Creates anticipation before collection (dopamine trigger per Vision.md research).

**Independent Test**: Approach object that's in magnetic range (player is 90%+ of threshold). Object should shimmer or emit trail particles as it moves toward player. Visual confirms "I'm about to collect this."

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** object is within magnetic range AND player is 90%+ of size threshold, **When** object is pulled toward player, **Then** object emits 1-2 trail particles per frame along movement path
2. **Given** object exits magnetic range, **When** magnetic pull stops, **Then** trail particles stop emitting (cleanup)
3. **Given** object is collected, **When** collection occurs, **Then** trail particles immediately stop (don't continue during absorption)

---

### Edge Cases

- What if 50 objects are collected simultaneously (big cluster)? **→ Limit particle emission to 500 total particles on screen (LittleJS handles 100K+ but conservative limit)**
- What if particles overlap and cause visual clutter? **→ Use additive blending for glow effect, particles fade quickly (0.5s max lifespan)**
- What about performance with many particles? **→ Constitution FR-021: Must maintain 60 FPS. If FPS drops, reduce particle count per emission**
- What if player is colorblind? **→ P4 consideration - particles use high-contrast yellow/orange (works for most colorblind types)**
- What about particle cleanup? **→ LittleJS auto-destroys particles after lifespan, no manual cleanup needed**

---

- **Particle**: Individual particle instance with position, velocity, color, size, lifespan
- **Collection Event**: Triggers particle burst when PlayerBall.collect() succeeds
- **Tier-Up Event**: Triggers large particle explosion when size threshold crossed
- **Magnetic Active State**: Boolean on Collectible indicating magnetic pull is active

## Clarifications

### Question 1: Particle Count Scaling Logic
**Q**: FR-005-002 specifies particle counts by object "value" (small/medium/large), but what are the exact value thresholds? Should it scale continuously with the actual dollar amount, or use discrete tiers?

**A**: Use **logarithmic scaling formula** (continuous, not discrete tiers). Industry best practice (2025) from Unity/Unreal shows continuous emission rate scaling prevents "sameness" within tiers and provides unique feedback for every collection while maintaining performance budget. Formula: `particleCount = Math.floor(10 + Math.log10(value + 1) * 15)` gives natural scaling: $1 = 10 particles, $100 = 40 particles, $10,000 = 70 particles (caps naturally).

**Updated Requirement**:
- **FR-005-002**: Particle count MUST scale logarithmically using formula `Math.floor(10 + Math.log10(value + 1) * 15)`, providing continuous scaling from 10 particles (low value) to 70 particles (high value)

---

### Question 2: Particle Performance Limit Behavior
**Q**: FR-005-012 requires maintaining 60 FPS with up to 500 particles. When this limit is reached (e.g., collecting 50 objects simultaneously = 1000+ particles), should the system skip emissions, reduce counts, queue emissions, or just let it happen?

**A**: Use **adaptive LOD reduction** (dynamic scaling). Industry best practice (2025) from Unity/Unreal LOD systems shows graceful degradation maintains game feel better than binary on/off. ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH confirms LittleJS handles "100,000+ particles at 60fps". Implement global emission multiplier: when active particles exceed 80% of budget (400), reduce all emissions by 50% until count drops below 50% (250).

**Updated Requirement**:
- **FR-005-013** (NEW): When active particles exceed 400 (80% of 500 limit), system MUST apply global `emissionMultiplier = 0.5` to all particle counts, restoring to `1.0` when count drops below 250

---

### Question 3: Magnetic Trail Particle Lifecycle
**Q**: FR-005-010 specifies "1-2 trail particles per frame when object.magnetActive === true", but the current Collectible class doesn't have a `magnetActive` property. Should we add this property, calculate inline, or defer to P4?

**A**: **Calculate inline** (no Collectible modification). Industry best practice (2025) shows Unity VFX Graph uses per-frame attraction force checks without object state properties. Calculate magnetic state as: `distance < player.magnetRange AND player.size >= collectible.sizeThreshold * 0.9`. This maintains separation of concerns and keeps Feature 001 code untouched.

**Updated Requirement**:
- **FR-005-010**: Magnetic trail particles MUST emit 1-2 per frame when `distance < player.magnetRange AND player.size >= collectible.sizeThreshold * 0.9` (calculated inline in Collectible.update(), no magnetActive property needed)

---

### Question 4: Tier-Up Particle Color Definition
**Q**: FR-005-008 says tier-up particles "MUST use golden/rainbow colors", but LittleJS ParticleEmitter uses 4 color values (colorStartA/B, colorEndA/B). Should "rainbow" mean random colors per particle, gradient, multiple emitters, or just golden?

**A**: **Golden gradient with rainbow variation** (hybrid approach). Industry best practice (2025) from celebration VFX packs shows golden-to-orange core with ±30° hue randomization creates "premium celebration" effect without visual chaos. Base golden colors (RGB 1,0.9,0.2 → 1,0.5,0) with 30% hue variation in colorStartB/colorEndB for diversity.

**Updated Requirement**:
- **FR-005-008**: Tier-up particles MUST use golden gradient base (colorStartA: rgb(1,0.9,0.2), colorEndA: rgb(1,0.5,0)) with ±30% hue randomization (colorStartB/colorEndB variations) for rainbow effect

---

### Question 5: Sprite Tile Availability
**Q**: FR-005-011 specifies "tile(48, 16) sprite (sparkle) or undefined for colored circles". Does the current sprite sheet actually have a sparkle sprite at tile 48, or should we use undefined by default?

**A**: **Default to `undefined` (colored circles)** with optional sparkle upgrade. Industry best practice (2025) shows LittleJS Particle System Designer defaults to `undefined` (procedural circles) with additive blending for standard "juice" particles. ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH tile map shows sparkle sprite is at tile 137, NOT tile 48 (spec error). Use `undefined` for simplicity and performance.

**Updated Requirement**:
- **FR-005-011**: Particles MUST use `undefined` (colored circles with additive blending) by default. Optional enhancement: Use `tile(137, 16)` for sparkle sprite (per ULTRA-DEEP-RESEARCH tile map, correcting original tile 48 reference)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of collection events trigger particle bursts (no silent collections)
- **SC-002**: Particle count correlates with object value (observable: small object = few particles, large object = many particles)
- **SC-003**: Tier-up explosions are visually MORE impressive than collection bursts (subjective but testable in playtesting)
- **SC-004**: Game maintains 60 FPS with 200+ collectibles and active particles (performance test)
- **SC-005**: Particles fade smoothly without pop-in/pop-out artifacts (visual quality test)
- **SC-006**: Players report "game looks way better" in playtesting (qualitative feedback)

### Game Jam Theme Validation

**Theme**: "SMALL"

**Theme Integration** (Constitution Article II):

- **Core Mechanic Connection**: Particle burst SIZE scales with object value - SMALL objects = small bursts, BIG objects = huge explosions. Visual scaling reinforces SMALL→BIG theme.
- **Visual Representation**: Particle density/count creates visual hierarchy matching theme (few particles = small impact, many particles = big impact).
- **Player Understanding**: Within 30 seconds, players see particle bursts grow from subtle (penny) to dramatic (rocket), reinforcing exponential growth.
- **Creative Interpretation**: "Your impact on the world grows" - particle explosions are visual metaphor for business disruption scale.

**Theme Success Criteria**:

- **TSC-001**: Particle burst size visibly increases as player grows and collects larger objects
- **TSC-002**: First collection (penny) vs last collection (rocket) have dramatically different particle counts
- **TSC-003**: Tier-up explosions signal "you've grown to next tier" without text explanation
- **TSC-004**: Particles enhance rather than obscure theme (don't clutter screen)

## Out of Scope *(final clarity)*

- ❌ Particle customization UI (settings) - P4
- ❌ Different particle shapes (stars, hearts, coins) - Not needed, simple sparkles sufficient
- ❌ Particle trails behind player (constant emission) - Could add but not in this spec
- ❌ Particle physics interactions (particles collide with objects) - Overkill
- ❌ Particle lighting effects (glow, bloom) - LittleJS additive blending is sufficient

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Deployed and tested
**Priority**: P3 - Week 3 (Oct 28-Nov 2)
**Actual Implementation Time**: ~3 hours (debugging ParticleEmitter signature)
**Impact**: HIGH (visual celebration transforms game feel)
