## 🎯 SPEC → CODE COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### **P3 Specs Cover ALL Missing FRs**

**Missing FR** → **Covered by Spec**:

| Missing FR | What's Missing | Spec That Implements It | Status |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| FR-030 | Screen shake | 003-add-screen-shake-feedback | ✅ Ready |
| FR-031 | Particle effects | 005-add-particle-effects | ✅ Ready |
| FR-032 | Popup text | 006-add-named-collectibles (includes popups) | ✅ Ready |
| FR-033 | Sound definitions | 004-add-zzfx-sound-system | ✅ Ready |
| FR-034 | SoundManager | 004-add-zzfx-sound-system | ✅ Ready |
| FR-042 | Named collectibles | 006-add-named-collectibles | ✅ Ready |
| FR-043 | Gen Alpha tone | 007-add-gen-alpha-personality | ✅ Ready |
| FR-048 | COLLECTIBLE_DATA (33 objects) | 006-add-named-collectibles | ⚠️ Partial (15-20 objects) |
| FR-050 | Combo system | 009-add-combo-system | ✅ Ready |
| FR-051 | Consumption log | 008-add-consumption-log | ✅ Ready |

**Coverage**: 10/10 missing P3 FRs have corresponding specs! ✅

**Gap**: FR-048 spec only requires 15-20 objects (not full 33). This is acceptable MVP - can add remaining 13-18 objects post-jam.

## 🔍 SPEC-KIT WORKFLOW VALIDATION

### **Constitution → Specs Alignment**: ✅ PERFECT

**Check 1**: Do specs reference Constitution?
- [x] Spec 003 references Article VI, FR-030
- [x] Spec 004 references Article VII, FR-033, FR-034
- [x] Spec 005 references Article VI, FR-031
- [x] Spec 006 references Article IX, FR-042, Article XI, FR-048
- [x] Spec 007 references Article IX, FR-043
- [x] Spec 008 references Article IX, FR-051
- [x] Spec 009 references Article XI, FR-050

**Result**: ✅ All specs correctly reference their authorizing Constitution articles

**Check 2**: Do specs follow template format?
- [x] All use `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` structure
- [x] All have mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- [x] All include Game Jam Theme Validation (project-specific requirement)
- [x] All use prioritized user stories (P3 marked)
- [x] All use Given/When/Then BDD format

**Result**: ✅ 100% Spec-Kit methodology compliance

**Check 3**: Do specs have independent testability?
- [x] Spec 003: Can test shake without sounds/particles/names
- [x] Spec 004: Can test sounds without shake/particles
- [x] Spec 005: Can test particles without sounds/shake
- [x] Spec 006: Can test names without sprites (text popups)
- [x] Spec 007: Can test Gen Alpha text independently
- [x] Spec 008: Can test consumption log independently
- [x] Spec 009: Can test combo system independently

**Result**: ✅ All specs are independently implementable (no forced dependencies)

### **Specs → Ready for Implementation**: ✅ READY

**No plan.md files yet** (expected - specs just created):
```bash
.specify/specs/003-add-screen-shake-feedback/
└── spec.md ✅ (176 lines)
    # plan.md → Will be created by /speckit.plan
    # tasks.md → Will be created by /speckit.tasks

.specify/specs/004-add-zzfx-sound-system/
└── spec.md ✅ (221 lines)
    # plan.md → Will be created by /speckit.plan
    # tasks.md → Will be created by /speckit.tasks

... (same pattern for 005-009)
```

**Next Step**: Call `/speckit.plan` from within each spec directory

## 🎮 VISION.MD → CODE ALIGNMENT

### **"It Factor" Formula Progress**:

**Constitution FR-041 Requirements**:
```
Theme (capitalism satire)      ⚠️ 70% - Has theme, lacks ironic humor
+ Mechanics (Katamari growth)  ✅ 100% - PERFECT implementation
+ Juice (shake/sound/particles) ❌ 0% - Completely missing
+ Progression (3 levels + combos) ⚠️ 60% - Has 3 levels, no combos
+ Personality (named + humor)  ❌ 0% - Generic objects/text
= IT FACTOR                    ⚠️ 46% - Mechanics brilliant, soul missing
```

**Vision.md "5 Critical Gaps"** → **Spec Coverage**:

1. ❌ **Visual Identity** (Rectangles → Named Sprites)
   - **Current**: Yellow/blue rectangles
   - **Target**: PENNY, TEACHER, YACHT sprites
   - **Spec**: 006-add-named-collectibles ✅
   - **Status**: Spec ready, not implemented

2. ❌ **Feedback Loops** (Silent → Shake+Sound+Particles)
   - **Current**: No shake, no sound, no particles
   - **Target**: Multi-sensory feedback
   - **Specs**: 003 (shake) ✅, 004 (sound) ✅, 005 (particles) ✅
   - **Status**: 3 specs ready, not implemented

3. ❌ **Personality** (Generic → Gen Alpha humor)
   - **Current**: "LEVEL COMPLETE!"
   - **Target**: "UNCOMMON GRINDSET UNLOCKED ✅"
   - **Spec**: 007-add-gen-alpha-personality ✅
   - **Status**: Spec ready, not implemented

4. ❌ **Progression** (Flat → Combo system)
   - **Current**: No combos, no bonuses
   - **Target**: COMBO x3/x5/x10 multipliers
   - **Spec**: 009-add-combo-system ✅
   - **Status**: Spec ready, not implemented

5. ❌ **Shareability** (Forgettable → Consumption logs)
   - **Current**: Basic score display
   - **Target**: "YOU CONSUMED: 8 TEACHERS (what)"
   - **Spec**: 008-add-consumption-log ✅
   - **Status**: Spec ready, not implemented

**Analysis**: ✅ **ALL 5 GAPS HAVE CORRESPONDING SPECS** - Vision diagnosis → Spec solution mapping is PERFECT

## 📋 RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

### **Phase 1: Validate Workflow (Day 1 - 1 hour)**

**Purpose**: Test Spec-Kit commands work before committing to all 7 specs

**Action**:
```bash
cd .specify/specs/003-add-screen-shake-feedback
/speckit.plan     # Generate plan.md
/speckit.tasks    # Generate tasks.md
/speckit.implement # Execute (should take 30-60 min)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] plan.md generated successfully
- [x] tasks.md breaks plan into atomic tasks
- [x] /speckit.implement executes tasks and writes code
- [x] Screen shake works (collect object, screen shakes!)
- [x] No errors, smooth workflow

**If successful** → HIGH confidence in remaining 6 specs
**If issues** → Debug workflow before proceeding

### **Phase 2: Core Juice (Days 2-3 - 4-5 hours)**

**Features**: Sound + Particles (biggest impact)

```bash
cd .specify/specs/004-add-zzfx-sound-system
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement

cd ../005-add-particle-effects
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
```

**Expected Outcome**: Game has audio + visual feedback = feels 10x better

### **Phase 3: Soul (Days 4-5 - 3-5 hours)**

**Features**: Named objects + Personality

```bash
cd .specify/specs/006-add-named-collectibles
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement

cd ../007-add-gen-alpha-personality
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
```

**Expected Outcome**: Game has character and humor = memorable

### **Phase 4: Engagement (Days 6-7 - 4-5 hours)**

**Features**: Consumption log + Combo (optional)

```bash
cd .specify/specs/008-add-consumption-log
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement

# Only if time permits:
cd ../009-add-combo-system
/speckit.plan
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
```

**Expected Outcome**: Game is shareable and replayable

**Total Time**: 12-16 hours across 7 days (comfortable!)

6. ✅ Process is sound (Spec-Kit → Constitution → Implementation)

**What to do RIGHT NOW**:

1. **Restart Claude Code** (File → Reload Window or full restart)
2. **Type `/` in chat** - You should see:
   ```
   /speckit.specify
   /speckit.clarify
   /speckit.plan
