## Top 3 Candidates

### ü•á #1: Physical Scale (Micro-Adventures)
**Theme Interpretation**: Player is ant-sized exploring everyday environments

**Pitch**: Navigate a kitchen from the perspective of a tiny character. Water droplets become obstacles with surface tension physics. Static electricity creates force fields. Ride dust particles through air currents. Climb surfaces using capillary action. Every level is a common household item (sink, table, windowsill) transformed into a massive physics playground.

**Physics Innovation**:
- Surface tension simulation (novel for web games)
- Electrostatic forces
- Scale-appropriate physics (different gravity feel)
- Fluid dynamics for droplets
- Air current simulation

**Why It Could Win**:
- Novel physics concepts rarely implemented in games
- Educational potential (real physics at small scales)
- Clear theme interpretation
- Strong visual identity
- Physics is core to gameplay, not decoration

**Prototypes Needed**:
1. Surface tension water droplet
2. Electrostatic push/pull mechanics
3. Air current particle system

---

### ü•à #2: Atomic Scale (Quantum Bonds)
**Theme Interpretation**: Build molecules at atomic scale

**Pitch**: Play as an electron navigating atomic structures. Use orbital mechanics to move between atoms. Create molecular bonds by positioning electrons correctly. Electromagnetic forces provide the physics challenges. Educational puzzle game teaching real chemistry through gameplay.

**Physics Innovation**:
- Accurate orbital mechanics
- Electromagnetic forces
- Multi-body gravitational systems
- Quantum-inspired effects (simplified)

**Why It Could Win**:
- Deeply educational

### ü•â #3: Growing from Small (Mass Effect)
**Theme Interpretation**: Start as tiny particle, grow through collection

**Pitch**: Begin as a dust particle. Collect debris to gain mass. As you grow, physics changes - momentum increases, air resistance becomes negligible, gravity affects you more. Navigate levels that become easier/harder as your scale changes. Speedrun-friendly with multiple paths based on size.

**Physics Innovation**:
- Dynamic physics based on mass
- Scale-dependent air resistance
- Momentum-based puzzles
- Mass affecting gravity interactions
