## Game Jam Preparation (October 2025)

### Workspace Setup Lessons

**Date**: October 13, 2025

**What Worked Well**:
- Comprehensive knowledge base creation before coding
- Spec Kit + Claude Code integration provides excellent workflow structure
- Shared component library (physics-helpers, particle-presets) prevents code duplication
- WSL2 Ubuntu environment on Windows provides best of both worlds
- Game initializer script automates tedious setup tasks

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Could add automated testing setup to game initializer
- May need asset pipeline tools as projects grow
- Could benefit from example prototypes to copy from

**Key Insights**:
1. **Organization pays off**: Time spent on directory structure and planning reduces friction later
2. **Reusability matters**: Shared components will save hours across multiple games
3. **Documentation is investment**: Comprehensive guides reduce cognitive load during development
4. **AI-assisted workflow**: Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code creates clear path from idea to implementation
5. **Physics focus**: Novel physics mechanics are the differentiator for the charity prize

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create 3 prototype experiments to validate physics helpers
- [ ] Document common game patterns in knowledge base
- [ ] Build example mini-game as template
- [ ] Test game initializer script with actual game creation
