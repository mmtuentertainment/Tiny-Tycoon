# Feature Specification: Level Progression System

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-a-3`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement a 3-level progression system where each level has a target size goal and time limit. Players must grow to the required size before time runs out to advance to the next level. Includes: Level data configuration (3 levels with increasing difficulty), timer countdown display, win condition check (reached target size), lose condition check (time expired), level transition screens (victory/defeat), and automatic progression to next level on win. Each level spawns fresh collectibles appropriate to the size range. Theme: Starting SMALL in each level with progressively larger goals."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: What happens after a player fails a level (defeat screen shown)? → A: Player can retry the failed level immediately from defeat screen
- Q: How many collectibles should spawn at any given time in each level? → A: Dynamic spawn count based on play area/level (30-50 for L1, 40-60 for L2, 50-80 for L3)
- Q: What format should the timer display use and when should urgency feedback trigger? → A: Display as MM:SS (e.g., "1:23") with urgency at 10 seconds
- Q: Can players skip transition screens or are they automatic only? → A: Automatic after 2-3 seconds, but skippable with any key press
- Q: How large should the play area be for each level and are there boundaries? → A: Fixed play area scaling with level (L1: 50x50, L2: 100x100, L3: 150x150 units) with soft boundaries

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Level Completion Flow (Priority: P1)

A player starts Level 1 at a small size and must collect objects to reach the target size before time runs out. Upon reaching the target size, they see a victory screen and proceed to Level 2.

**Why this priority**: This is the core gameplay loop and must work for the game to be playable. Without level progression, the game has no structure or goals.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by playing Level 1, collecting objects until reaching target size, and verifying the transition to Level 2 occurs with victory feedback. Delivers the complete single-level experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player starts Level 1 at size 0.5, **When** player collects objects and reaches target size (e.g., 5.0) before timer expires, **Then** victory screen displays and Level 2 begins
2. **Given** player is in Level 2, **When** player reaches Level 2 target size before timer expires, **Then** victory screen displays and Level 3 begins
3. **Given** player is in Level 3, **When** player reaches Level 3 target size before timer expires, **Then** game completion/victory screen displays

---

### User Story 2 - Failure Condition and Retry (Priority: P1)

A player who fails to reach the target size before time expires sees a defeat screen and can immediately retry the same level without losing overall game progress.

**Why this priority**: Failure conditions are essential for challenge and meaningful gameplay. Without time pressure and consequences, there's no urgency or tension. Immediate retry capability reduces frustration while maintaining challenge.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a level and intentionally letting the timer expire without reaching target size. Verifies defeat feedback works independently of victory flow and retry functionality restarts the same level.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player is in any level with active timer, **When** timer reaches 0 and player has not reached target size, **Then** defeat screen displays with current size and target size shown
2. **Given** player sees defeat screen, **When** screen displays, **Then** clear feedback indicates failure reason (time expired) and current/target size comparison
3. **Given** player sees defeat screen, **When** retry option is selected or defeat screen timer expires, **Then** same level restarts from beginning with fresh collectibles and full time limit

---

### User Story 3 - Timer Awareness and Urgency (Priority: P1)

A player can always see the remaining time and understands how much time they have left to complete the level objective.

**Why this priority**: The timer is a core constraint of the game design. Players must be able to make strategic decisions based on remaining time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by observing the timer display throughout gameplay, verifying it counts down accurately and is clearly visible at all times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player starts a level, **When** gameplay begins, **Then** timer displays current time remaining in MM:SS format (e.g., "1:00", "0:45") and counts down each second
2. **Given** player is playing any level, **When** timer reaches 10 seconds remaining (0:10), **Then** timer provides visual urgency feedback (color change to red/orange, pulse animation)
3. **Given** timer reaches exactly 0, **When** failure condition triggers, **Then** timer stops and shows 0:00

---

### User Story 4 - Level-Appropriate Collectible Spawning (Priority: P2)

Each level spawns collectibles appropriate to the player's current size range, ensuring the player can always find objects to collect for progression.

**Why this priority**: This ensures smooth difficulty progression and prevents frustration from collectibles being too small or too large for the current level.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by observing collectible sizes across all three levels and verifying they scale appropriately with level difficulty and target sizes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Level 1 starts (small size range 0.5-5.0), **When** collectibles spawn, **Then** 30-50 collectibles range from 0.3 to 3.0 in size
2. **Given** Level 2 starts (medium size range 5.0-15.0), **When** collectibles spawn, **Then** 40-60 collectibles range from 3.0 to 10.0 in size
3. **Given** Level 3 starts (large size range 15.0-50.0), **When** collectibles spawn, **Then** 50-80 collectibles range from 10.0 to 40.0 in size
4. **Given** new level begins, **When** level loads, **Then** all previous level collectibles are cleared and fresh collectibles appropriate to new level spawn

---

### User Story 5 - Progressive Difficulty Scaling (Priority: P2)

Each successive level becomes more challenging through a combination of larger target sizes, adjusted time limits, and increased size requirements.

**Why this priority**: Provides meaningful progression and keeps the game engaging across all three levels.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing all three levels in sequence and verifying each feels appropriately more challenging than the previous.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Level 1 configuration, **When** level parameters are checked, **Then** target size is 5.0, timer is 60 seconds, play area is 50x50 units, difficulty is "Easy"
2. **Given** Level 2 configuration, **When** level parameters are checked, **Then** target size is 15.0, timer is 90 seconds, play area is 100x100 units, difficulty is "Medium"
3. **Given** Level 3 configuration, **When** level parameters are checked, **Then** target size is 50.0, timer is 120 seconds, play area is 150x150 units, difficulty is "Hard"

---

### User Story 6 - Clear Goal Visibility (Priority: P2)

Player always knows their current size, target size, and how close they are to completing the level objective.

**Why this priority**: Clear feedback prevents player confusion and allows strategic decision-making.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by checking HUD displays size information accurately throughout gameplay.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player is in any level, **When** HUD is visible, **Then** current size and target size are clearly displayed (e.g., "Size: 2.5 / 5.0")
2. **Given** player collects objects and grows, **When** size changes, **Then** HUD updates in real-time to reflect new size
3. **Given** player reaches target size, **When** win condition is met, **Then** HUD provides visual confirmation (e.g., size indicator turns green, celebration effect)

---

### User Story 7 - Smooth Level Transitions (Priority: P3)

Transitions between levels feel polished with clear feedback screens that inform the player of their success or failure before moving to the next state.

**Why this priority**: Polish and user experience. The core gameplay works without fancy transitions, but they significantly improve game feel.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing or failing levels and observing transition screens for clarity and timing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** player completes a level, **When** victory condition triggers, **Then** victory screen displays with level completion stats (final size, time remaining) and auto-advances after 2-3 seconds
2. **Given** player fails a level, **When** defeat condition triggers, **Then** defeat screen displays with failure reason and encouragement to retry and auto-advances after 2-3 seconds
3. **Given** transition screen is showing, **When** player presses any key/button, **Then** screen immediately skips to next game state
4. **Given** transition screen is showing and player does not skip, **When** 2-3 seconds elapse, **Then** automatic progression to next game state occurs (next level or retry)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when player reaches target size at the exact moment timer expires? (Should favor player - win condition)
- What happens if Level 3 is completed? (Game victory/completion screen, return to main menu or credits)
- How does system handle rapid size changes near target size threshold? (Should check win condition immediately on size change)
- What if player somehow shrinks below starting size? (Should be prevented by core mechanic - can only grow)
- How does timer pause/resume work if game is paused? (Timer should pause when game pauses)
- What happens if all collectibles are too large to collect? (Ensure spawning algorithm always provides appropriately-sized objects)
- What happens if player tries to move beyond soft boundaries? (Camera stops following at boundary edge, player can still move but stays visible within play area)
- What if collectibles spawn outside play area boundaries? (Spawning algorithm must respect play area dimensions)

- **SC-002**: Timer accurately counts down from specified time limit and triggers failure when reaching 0
- **SC-003**: Win condition triggers immediately when target size is reached (within 1 frame)
- **SC-004**: Each level spawns collectibles only within specified size range appropriate to that level
- **SC-005**: Victory and defeat screens display with clear feedback, auto-advance after 2-3 seconds, and are immediately skippable by player input
- **SC-006**: HUD displays current size, target size, and remaining time accurately throughout gameplay
- **SC-007**: 90% of playtesters understand level objectives and progression without external instruction

### Game Jam Theme Validation *(include only for game jam projects)*

**Theme**: SMALL

**Theme Integration** (Constitution Article - Theme Requirements):

- **Core Mechanic Connection**: Each level reinforces the "SMALL to BIG" journey by resetting the player to small size and requiring them to grow again. The progression system creates multiple cycles of the "starting small" experience, emphasizing transformation through exponential growth.

- **Visual Representation**: Level transition screens can emphasize the journey from SMALL (starting size 0.5) to progressively larger sizes (5.0 → 15.0 → 50.0), showing dramatic scale changes through size comparisons and visual feedback.

- **Player Understanding**: Within 30 seconds of each level, players experience the same "starting SMALL" moment, reinforcing the theme through repetition and escalation. The timer creates urgency around growth, making the SMALL→BIG transformation feel meaningful.

- **Creative Interpretation**: Rather than one continuous growth experience, this feature interprets "SMALL" as a cyclical rebirth concept - players repeatedly start small and must prove themselves by growing big, creating a "small beginnings, big achievements" narrative.

**Theme Success Criteria**:

- **TSC-001**: Players clearly understand they start SMALL at each level (size 0.5 consistently)
- **TSC-002**: Progression between levels demonstrates exponential scale growth (5x → 3x → 3.3x multipliers)
- **TSC-003**: 90% of playtesters recognize the "start small, grow big" pattern across all three levels
- **TSC-004**: Level transition screens emphasize size comparison and growth achievement
