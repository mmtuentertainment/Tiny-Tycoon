# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Katamari Mechanic

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning LittleJS, JavaScript, classes, or technical implementation. Uses technology-agnostic language like "player ball," "collectible objects," "keyboard inputs."
- **User value focused**: All user stories explain "why this priority" and business value. Focus on player experience and theme alignment.
- **Non-technical language**: Written for game designers and stakeholders. Terms like "momentum-based physics" and "exponential growth" describe player-visible behavior, not code.
- **All sections complete**: User Scenarios (4 stories), Requirements (18 FRs), Success Criteria (10 SCs + 4 TSCs), Key Entities (4), Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are fully specified with concrete details. Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults.
- **Testable requirements**: Every FR uses "MUST" and describes observable behavior (e.g., "ball MUST respond to WASD inputs" - testable by pressing keys).
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SCs include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "within 30 seconds"
  - SC-002: "60 frames per second with at least 100 objects"
  - SC-003: "10x larger within 60 seconds"
  - SC-004: "90% of playtesters"
  - SC-006: "no more than 1 frame (16ms) delay"
- **Technology-agnostic SCs**: No mention of implementation details. All criteria describe user-visible outcomes (performance, timing, player understanding).
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: 26 total Given/When/Then scenarios across 4 user stories, covering all primary flows and edge cases.
- **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases with answers: same-size collision, magnetic boundaries, empty screen, max size, camera bounds, collision overlap, zero velocity.
- **Scope bounded**: Clear P1/P2 priorities, detailed "Out of Scope" section excluding 11 features deferred to P2/P3/P4.
- **Dependencies/assumptions documented**: 3 dependencies listed, 9 assumptions documented with rationale.

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- **FRs have acceptance criteria**: All 18 FRs mapped to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Each FR testable through corresponding Given/When/Then.
- **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 4 user stories cover complete core loop (movement → collection → growth → feedback).
- **Meets success criteria**: Specification directly addresses all 10 SCs and 4 TSCs with corresponding FRs and user stories.
- **No implementation leaks**: Verified - specification describes "what" and "why" without "how." No code, no framework mentions, no technical architecture.

## Overall Status: READY FOR PLANNING ✅

All validation items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, testable, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths

1. **Exceptional theme alignment**: Theme integration section demonstrates deep understanding of "SMALL" theme embodiment in core mechanic
2. **Clear prioritization**: P1/P2 labels on user stories support incremental delivery (US1-3 are P1 core loop, US4 is P2 enhancement)
3. **Comprehensive edge case handling**: 7 edge cases identified with documented answers prevents ambiguity during implementation
4. **Measurable outcomes**: All success criteria include specific metrics (time, FPS, percentages) enabling objective validation
5. **Scope discipline**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly defers 11 features, preventing scope creep and aligning with constitution timeline

### Notes

- Specification is highly detailed (200 lines) but appropriate for P1 foundation feature
- Constitution principles (Articles I-V) referenced throughout, ensuring governance compliance
- Independent testability for each user story supports parallel development if needed
- Assumptions section provides clear defaults for technical planning phase
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for technical architecture and implementation approach
