## Phase-by-Phase Audit

### Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005) - ✅ 5/5 COMPLETE (100%)

| Task | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| T001 | Verify LittleJS engine available | ✅ DONE | Verified at ../../LittleJS/dist/littlejs.release.js |
| T002 | Verify index.html loads scripts | ✅ DONE | Both scripts load correctly |
| T003 | Verify dev server works | ✅ DONE | Server runs from workspace root on port 8000 |
| T004 | Verify no console errors | ✅ DONE | Only AudioContext warning (expected, not error) |
| T005 | Verify callbacks exist | ✅ DONE | All 5 LittleJS callbacks present |

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Development environment operational

---

### Phase 2: Foundation (T006-T008) - ✅ 3/3 COMPLETE (100%)

| Task | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| T006 | Add COLLECTIBLE_DATA config | ✅ DONE | Added in gameInit() due to Color dependency |
| T007 | Add global player variable | ✅ DONE | Line 22: `let player;` |
| T008 | Verify COLLECTIBLE_DATA accessible | ✅ DONE | Initialized in gameInit, accessible in console |

**Deviation**: COLLECTIBLE_DATA moved to gameInit() instead of top-level due to `new Color()` requiring LittleJS to load first.

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Foundation ready

---

### Phase 3: User Story 1 - Player Movement (T009-T018) - ✅ 10/10 COMPLETE (100%)

| Task | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|

| T010 | Implement constructor | ✅ DONE | Lines 222-230, all properties set |
| T011 | Implement update() with WASD/Arrow | ✅ DONE | Lines 232-246, both control schemes |
| T012 | Add render() method | ✅ DONE | Lines 294-297, drawRect |
| T013 | Update gameInit() to create player | ✅ DONE | Line 54, player = new PlayerBall(vec2(0,0)) |
| T014 | Update gameUpdate() with camera lerp | ✅ DONE | Lines 62-63, lerp factor 0.1 |

| T017 | Manual test: momentum + damping | ✅ DONE | Velocity decay verified in console logs |
| T018 | Manual test: camera follow | ✅ DONE | Grid movement confirms camera follow |

**Deviations**:
- Physics tuned differently: moveSpeed 0.03 (task spec'd 0.2), damping 0.5 (task spec'd 0.9)
- Added manual collision detection in update() (lines 248-261, not in original tasks)
- Added grid reference lines in gameRender() for visual feedback (lines 76-85, not in tasks)
- Added error handlers (lines 303-308, not in Phase 3 tasks)
- Added engineInit() startup call (line 319, debugged initialization issue)

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Player Movement & Control complete and tested

---

| T028 | Manual test: collect coin | ✅ DONE | Coins disappear, score increases |
| T029 | Manual test: cannot collect customer | ✅ DONE | Customers too big initially |
| T030 | Manual test: same-size edge case | ❌ NOT DONE | Not explicitly tested |
| T031 | Manual test: engineObjects.length | ❌ NOT DONE | Not verified in console |

**Deviations**:
- Collectible mass changed from 0 to 0.1 for collision detection
- Added collideSolidObjects = true for both classes
- Manual collision detection added as primary method (LittleJS auto-collision backup)

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Collection system working (2 tests skipped)

---

### Phase 5: User Story 3 - Growth (T032-T039) - ✅ 3/8 COMPLETE (38%)

| Task | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| T040 | Calculate distanceToPlayer | ✅ DONE | Line 184 |
| T041 | Add magnetic logic with conditions | ✅ DONE | Lines 187-203 |

## What Actually Works vs What Was Tested

### ✅ Implemented and Working
- Player movement with WASD/Arrow keys
- Momentum physics (tuned to 0.03 speed, 0.5 damping)
- Camera follow with lerp
- 144 collectibles spawning on randomized grid
- Size-based collision detection
- Collection mechanics (coins and customers)
- Exponential growth formula
- Magnetic attraction (tuned to 1.2 range)
- HUD display (size, score, title)

### ⚠️ Implemented but Not Thoroughly Tested
- Exponential growth curve (works but not measured against 10x in 60s spec)
- Magnetic attraction (works but heavily tuned, not tested per original spec)
- HUD updates (visible but not verified to update correctly)
- Edge cases (same-size collision, empty screen, etc.)

### ❌ Not Tested At All (Phase 8)
- Performance at 60 FPS with 100+ objects
- Theme identification by playtesters
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Constitution compliance verification
- Quality gate checklist
- Edge case scenarios

---

## Scope Issue Analysis

### What Went Wrong

**Problem**: Created ONE massive spec instead of incremental specs

**Should Have Been**:
- Spec 001: Player Movement only (10 tasks, 2-3 hours)
- Spec 002: Collection System only (13 tasks, 3-4 hours)
- Spec 003: Growth System only (8 tasks, 2 hours)
- Spec 004: HUD Display only (9 tasks, 2 hours)

**What Happened**:
- Spec 001: ALL FOUR features (88 tasks, estimated 9 hours)
- Resulted in rushing through implementation
- Skipped comprehensive testing (Phase 8: 31 tasks, ~2 hours)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Spec-Kit principle violated**: Each spec should be ONE independently deliverable feature
2. **Task breakdown too granular**: 88 tasks for one feature is unmanageable
3. **Testing shortcuts**: Skipped 46 of 88 tasks (all validation/testing tasks)
4. **Human-in-loop saved us**: Iterative testing caught issues (physics tuning, magnet strength)

## `/speckit.implement` Actual Status

**Command Status**: ❌ NOT COMPLETE

**Reason**: Phase 8 (Integration & Validation) not executed

**What Would Complete It**:
- Execute T058-T088 (31 validation tasks)
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Includes: performance testing, edge cases, cross-browser, theme validation

---

## Recommendation

**Option A**: Mark feature "Functionally Complete, Validation Pending"
- Game works and is playable
- Skip Phase 8 for P1 (time-constrained jam)
- Move to P2 features (levels, win/lose)

**Option B**: Execute Phase 8 validation tasks
- Run all 31 tests systematically
- Document results
- Achieve true 100% completion

**Option C**: Split this into proper incremental specs
- Close current spec as "overscoped"
- Create new specs for magnetic + HUD as separate features
- Follow proper Spec-Kit methodology going forward

---

**Actual vs Claimed**:
- ❌ INCORRECT: "88 tasks complete"
- ✅ CORRECT: "42 tasks complete (48%), feature playable and functional"
- ⚠️ HONEST: "Comprehensive testing (Phase 8) skipped for speed"

**Quality**: Game works well through iterative human-in-loop testing, but formal validation suite not executed.
