## Emergency Fixes (Last Hour)

### Critical Issues Only

**If game won't load**:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify all asset paths
3. Test index.html locally
4. Re-upload if necessary

**If major bug found**:
1. Can it be worked around?
2. Is it game-breaking?
3. Fix only if critical
4. Re-test after fix
5. Re-upload carefully

**If performance issues**:
1. Reduce particle counts
2. Lower object limits
3. Disable expensive effects
4. Add performance warnings

### What NOT to Fix

**Don't touch** (unless game-breaking):
- Minor visual glitches
- Rare edge case bugs
- Polish improvements
- Feature additions
- Refactoring

**Better to submit working game with minor bugs than risk breaking it!**

## Submission Troubleshooting

**Solutions**:
1. Check index.html is entry point
2. Verify all paths are relative
3. Check browser console on itch.io
